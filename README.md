Custom book reader for personal use

updated todo:
----------------
- ui:
	- create common button class:
		- button will have an 'action'
		- while action is 'busy', icon will change to refresh & spin
		- 'button' can also be an image
		- each action will be like a resource & have a status
			- this means that if multiple buttons have the same action,
			  clicking one will make both 'busy'
