# brooke
Custom book reader for personal use

updated todo:
----------------
- Convert ocr.properties into cbtDetails.yaml
- Add a panel to create the OCR details as a part of brooke / angular app instead of java swing

	- and i don't want to maintain a swing app
	- use thumbnails from the .thumbnails folder
- remove .png from ocr properties file names
